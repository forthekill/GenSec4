	GenSec4 - A Traveller sector generator

    Based on Marc Miller, "Traveller Sector Generator", Using Your
	Model 2/BIS, Challenge No. 25; and other Traveller material
	(Referee's Manual and issues of Traveller's Digest.)

    The format of the output of gensec is a superset of the material
    produced by Mr. Miller's published program, and can be formatted
	in a number of ways.

	Each output file uses the first line to identify the version of the
	output format. This same string is used by the mapsub program to
	interpret the data correctly.

	The format line consists of the text "#Version: x.x" with the value
	of x.x depending on which style of output was chosen.

	Version numbers are as follows:

	Version	Description
	1.0	    Original Standard UPP .sec format
	2.0	    New Standard UWP format (GEnie) .sec format
	2.1		Heaven & Earth/Galactic .sec format
	2.2		Heaven & Earth .hes format
	2.3		Gensec/mapsec/subsec v2 .sec format
	2.5		travellermap.com API output .sec format
	3.0		TBD: Sector XML format

	worlds was added, and to set density of 'zero'.
